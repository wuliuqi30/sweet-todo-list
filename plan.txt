The overall plan for how to make the to do list

Basic display: 

user? 
user information is displayed at the top in header. 
- at first, it'll default to an automatic name and information then you can edit it later.
- once information can be saved, it will start by prompting the user for information (name and email address) and then save that for next time.



To Do Items: class
a container with information about something you need to do
-task 
-description (optional)
-deadline (optional) ; how to implement this?should be a date 
-do at (optional) (Implement in phase 2)
-priority (optional) : normal,high, urgent
-project (optional, default is the general category)

background things: 
- unique id

other things you can do: 
- delete button to delete the task permanently
- edit button: bring up a modify task screen identical to the create task screen to allow modification : check
- each time you make it, it is a different color, chosen randomly from a color theme.
- completed button to check once its complete

visualization: sticky note with tack



Projects: class?
an unordered list of tasks organized under one collective label
if no project is specified, to-do items go into the "general" project


- organize button to reorganize the tasks on the project based on various things, like: due date, do date, priority
project.organizeDisplay('doBy') 'doAt' 'creation' 'priority': just a function to edit the DOM, doesn't change the items in the actual project
: done, sorting by age and priority done

- add task button to create a new task and stick it to the wall
Add Task: button with an event listener which opens a modal dialog form to fill in information with a submit button that saves that information
then puts it into the display (or delete the current board and repopulates it with all the tasks.)
At first it will just put it right into the board, not organized in any way. 
--> instance function of class Project:  project.putTodoOnBoard(todo); manipulate DOM


visualization: wall (officey looking wall)

sticky note: 
- all the task informatin on it
plus a delete button and a complete button




Calendar: 
A time-ordered list of all tasks with a due date or do date
When you click on the calendar option, its function is to arrange the items on a page by due date


Nice to Haves: 
Search bar: searches for both projects and todo items


22 august
- implement a format for deadline ; done
- implement sort by deadline ; done
- generate random color when put item into project
- implement a button/form to add a new task/edit existing task
- implement putting that new task onto the screen with its corresponding information



24 august
- get the input task, retrieval of task data and basic display on the screen working
- get the project from a form, basic display on screen

25 Aug: 

- add completed tasks list to each project
- create project display
- implement complete tasks function which puts tasks in the completed section. and can go back the other way. 

Need to make: 
refresh project page (project)
- delete current - done
- header, incopmlete, completed- done
- put sticky note on board - done
- delete sticky note - done


- mark completed with button done
- show in either complete or incomplete displays. done
- move from incomplete to complete done
- move frmo complete to incomplete done
- switch to new project button. done


8/26

- reformat layout

Features: 
- Sort by button on finished and unfinished task list
- display projects on left side that are clickable - done
- display all upcoming tasks on the right side- done (future: make clickable)
    - can filter by project as well
- fixed sizing for task board - done



Style:
- spend time getting sizing and padding looking better - did some
- get a good font and color scheme - some
- research how to get a sticky note design  - done
- background designs for the wall 
- Today's date in the header 
- adjust header acc to design  
- implement a basic local storage

Future: 
- Search bar actually works and finds the task
- To do items in the main display are clickable which highlights them 
and potentially pulls up a small display with options to complete, delete, move, or edit.
- check out others and get ideas for features to add: 

ideas: 
- no separate completed/non completed section, just one sectoin, but a button that allows
you to view completed tasks. and completed tasks will have a slight greyed outness to them. done
- project view section has a button for displayed completed tasks. done
- project view has a title on top for "Remaining tasks" vs. "copmleted tasks" done 
- mark completed tasks with words that say " completed on ..."
- change font for sticky notes - done
- get rid of 0's in "due" - done
- adjust button positiosn on top - done
- on top add a button for "generate example" as well as "clear everything" with a confirmation  - done
- projects in project nav on the left-hand side -done
- project names have a unique font which is reflected everwhere - done


8-28: 
final things to do: 
put the projects title inside the tasksboard box itself
