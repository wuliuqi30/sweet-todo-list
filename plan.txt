The overall plan for how to make the to do list

Basic display: 

user? 
user information is displayed at the top in header. 
- at first, it'll default to an automatic name and information then you can edit it later.
- once information can be saved, it will start by prompting the user for information (name and email address) and then save that for next time.



To Do Items: class
a container with information about something you need to do
-task 
-description (optional)
-deadline (optional) ; how to implement this?should be a date 
-do at (optional) (Implement in phase 2)
-priority (optional) : normal,high, urgent
-project (optional, default is the general category)

background things: 
- unique id

other things you can do: 
- delete button to delete the task permanently
- edit button: bring up a modify task screen identical to the create task screen to allow modification : check
- each time you make it, it is a different color, chosen randomly from a color theme.
- completed button to check once its complete

visualization: sticky note with tack



Projects: class?
an unordered list of tasks organized under one collective label
if no project is specified, to-do items go into the "general" project


- organize button to reorganize the tasks on the project based on various things, like: due date, do date, priority
project.organizeDisplay('doBy') 'doAt' 'creation' 'priority': just a function to edit the DOM, doesn't change the items in the actual project
: done, sorting by age and priority done

- add task button to create a new task and stick it to the wall
Add Task: button with an event listener which opens a modal dialog form to fill in information with a submit button that saves that information
then puts it into the display (or delete the current board and repopulates it with all the tasks.)
At first it will just put it right into the board, not organized in any way. 
--> instance function of class Project:  project.putTodoOnBoard(todo); manipulate DOM


visualization: wall (officey looking wall)

sticky note: 
- all the task informatin on it
plus a delete button and a complete button




Calendar: 
A time-ordered list of all tasks with a due date or do date
When you click on the calendar option, its function is to arrange the items on a page by due date


Nice to Haves: 
Search bar: searches for both projects and todo items
